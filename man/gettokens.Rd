\title{Function to read in the .tokens files associated with each BookNLP parsed text.
The .tokens file simply contains details (part of speech, lemmatized form, link to character)
about each token (word or punctuation mark) in the text.
This function aims to simply gather all the .tokens files, and store them in one object ("token_files").
The output to this function can then be used if somebody is interested in the plain text of a document,
rather than the BookNLP parse of the document.}
